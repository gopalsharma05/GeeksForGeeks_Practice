   problem->  Delete_middle_element_of_a_stack(good).cpp

Given a stack with push(), pop(), empty() operations, delete the middle of it without using any additional data structure.
Middle: ceil(size_of_stack/2.0)


Example 1:

Input:
sizeOfStack = 5
stack = [1 2 3 4 5]
Output:
modifiedStack = [1 2 4 5]
Explanation:
As the number of elements is 5 ,
hence the middle element will be the 3rd
element which is deleted
Example 2:

Input:
sizeOfStack = 4
stack = [1 2 3 4]
Output:
modifiedStack = [1 3 4]
Explanation:
As the number of elements is 4 ,
hence the middle element will be the 2nd
â€‹element which is deleted


Your Task:
This is a function problem. The input is already taken by the driver code. You only need to complete the function deleteMid() which takes 3
arguments(stack, size of the stack, and current index - initially 0) and returns the modified stack.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).

Constraints:
1 <= sizeOfStack <= 100

Note: The output on the console is printed in reverse order of elements in the modified stack.
